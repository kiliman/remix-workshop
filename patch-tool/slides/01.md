# Unblocking Yourself

As with most software projects, you'll get to a point where you're stuck. It's either because some framework or library you're using has a bug, or you simply wished it worked differently.

Although it may seem cathartic to create a scathing issue in GitHub as to how terrible the package is and berate the maintainers into dropping everything to fix your bug or add your feature now!

I'm a firm believer in "You're responsible for your app." I treat any open source software as "software that I didn't have to write", so I'm already ahead in the game. Any issues that arise that block me from moving forward, is my responsibility. I'm ultimately responsible to my users and my boss to resolve the problem and move on. Granted, this is easier said than done. Hopefully, there's a work around, while a bug fix is being worked on.

Anyway, sometimes you just have to go in and hack at the offending code and beat it into submission.
