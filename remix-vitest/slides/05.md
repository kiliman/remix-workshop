# End-to-end testing with Playwright

The Remix stacks currently use `cypress` for integration testing. However, a relatively new library makes it simple to do end-to-end testing.

Playwright works similarly to cypress in that it automates a hidden browser. You write your test as a script that specifies what page to navigate to, what form fields to fill in, links or buttons to click, etc. Then you simply assert that certain things are rendered as expected or some action is triggered.

```ts
import { expect, test } from "@playwright/test";

let baseURL = process.env.URL || "http://localhost:3000";

test.describe("example", () => {
  test("changes name on submit", async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto(baseURL);
    await expect(
      await page.locator("h1", { hasText: "Hello, World!" })
    ).toBeVisible();

    await page.locator('input[name="name"]').fill("Test");
    await page.locator('button[type="submit"]').press("Enter");

    await expect(
      await page.locator("h1", { hasText: "Hello, Test Fail!" })
    ).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```
