# Prisma Schemas

A typical Prisma app consists of a single schema with all the models defined within in. Although Prisma does have _multi-schema_ support, this is used to group Prisma models together. You still have a single database and a single set of tables for each model.

## Postgres Multi-Schema

As stated before, `postgres` lets you duplicate your models for each tenant which is namespaced by the schema name.

Here we have a `public` schema that contains the `Tenant` model, which is a list of tenants.

Then we have a separate `tenant` schema for each tenant that has been created.

You can see that we have 2 tenants: tenant1 and tenant2.

Each has their own set of _User_ and _Note_ tables.
