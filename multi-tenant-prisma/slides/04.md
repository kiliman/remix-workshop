# Onboarding a New Tenant

I created a simple page to onboard a new tenant. It's simply a form that has the tenant name and the host header to use.

When it is submitted, it will check for an existing tenant, and will add a new tenant. It then runs a process to deploy the new tenant schema to the database.

```bash
schemaFile="${SCRIPT_DIR}/$schema/schema.prisma"

DATABASE_URL="$DATABASE_URL?schema=$tenant" npx prisma migrate dev --schema "$schemaFile" --skip-generate
```

Since prisma uses the environment variable `DATABASE_URL` to indentify the server and database to connect to, I use the ability to specify the schema name as part of the URL.

By including the schema name, Prisma will ensure a new schema is created in the database and all queries will use that schema.
