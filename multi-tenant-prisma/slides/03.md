# Managing Prisma Schemas

In order to support this model, we first define a `public` schema in _prisma/public_ and a `tenant` schema in _prisma/tenant_. Prisma allows us to specify the schema file when using the CLI and we use this to select the correct schema.

```bash
npx prisma generate --schema prisma/public/schema.prisma
```

## Setup

Since we're using Postgres for this example, there is a _docker-compose.yml_ file to initialize the docker container.

```bash
npx run docker
npx run setup # run the prisma/setup script
```

There is a _prisma/setup_ script that will first initialize the `public` schema. This will create the main _Tenant_ model used for onboarding.

It then will generate the Prisma client files. There are a couple of steps needed to support this. Unfortunately prisma doesn't have a CLI flag to specify the output location. You need to add this to the schema file itself. By default, it will be generated in _node_modules/.prisma/client_. Here we want to create a separate folder for both `public` and `tenant` schemas.

```ts
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "../../node_modules/.prisma/client/public" // tenant folder for tenant schema
}
```

Also prisma creates an alias package `@prisma/client` that re-exports from the generated folder. Here we want to re-export from `@prisma/client/public`.

```ts
// app/prisma/public.ts
export * from '@prisma/client/public'
```
