# Prisma Migrations

When building an app, new features will typically required changes to your existing schema. Prisma supports modifying the schema, and creating a migration that will create the necessary scripts to update your existing database with these changes.

Since we now have potentially many tenant schemas, we need to ensure that **all** of them are updated to the current version.

You change your schema models as before. When you are ready to deploy those migrations to your dev database, you will run the script: `prisma/prisma-migrate-dev-all`.

This script first connects to the public schema and retrieves a list of all the tenants current in the database (`get-tenants.ts`)

It then loops through each tenant and runs the standard migrate command per tenant schema.

As usual, the first tenant will prompt you to name the migration. Prisma creates the script and applies it to the database. For subsequent tenants, it simply applies the migration from the tenant schema folder to the database.

## Production Migrations

The technique for migrating the production server will be similar to dev and is left as an exercise.
