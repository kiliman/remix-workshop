# Rendering multi-page forms

There are many ways to render a multi-page form. For example, you could have a single route with a single form, and simply show or hide the inputs based on which page the user is currently on.

With this way, it is important that you return the current page's data, since no local state is used. This way if the user navigates back to a previous page, the data will be restored.

```ts
export const loader = async ({ request }: LoaderArgs) => {
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const page = Number(url.searchParams.get("page") ?? "1");
  const session = await getSession(request.headers.get("cookie"));

  if (page < 4) {
    const data = session.get(`form-data-page-${page}`) ?? {};
    return json({ page, data });
  } else {
    // final page so just collect all the data to render
    const data = {
      ...session.get(`form-data-page-1`),
      ...session.get(`form-data-page-2`),
      ...session.get(`form-data-page-3`),
    };
    return json({ page, data });
  }
};

export default function MultiPageForm() {
  const transition = useTransition();
  const showSpinner = useSpinDelay(transition.state !== "idle", {
    delay: 200,
    minDuration: 300,
  });

  const loaderData = useLoaderData();
  const page = Number(loaderData.page);
  const data = loaderData.data;

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <Form method="post" className="space-y-8 divide-y divide-gray-200">
        <input name="page" type="hidden" value={page} />
        <div className="space-y-8 divide-y divide-gray-200 sm:space-y-5">
          {page === 1 && <div>Show page 1 form...</div>}
          {page === 2 && <div>Show page 2 form...</div>}
          {page === 3 && <div>Show page 3 form...</div>}
          {page === 4 && <div>Show final results...</div>}
        </div>
      </Form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Another option would be to create separate routes, where each route has it's own `Form` and `loader/action`. This should probably only be used for really complex forms, where you need extra logic in your loader and action.

I've also implemented a `multi-section` form. Instead of navigating through different pages, there is a single form with collapsible panels. Each panel is a mini-form. These panels are separate components where all the form logic is component-specific, but they use the same data from the route loader and post to the same action.
